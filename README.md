# predict inpatient hospital length of stay
Predicting the Length of Stay for hospital inpatients is a common problem in healthcare analytics. It involves using historical data and machine learning techniques to develop models that can estimate the duration of a patient's stay in the hospital. Hospitals have limited resources, requiring efficient use of beds and clinician time. For these reasons and more, it is in the best interest of patients, hospitals, and public health to limit any hospital stay to no longer than necessary and to have an idea of how long a given inpatient may need to stay. In this way, the ability to predict how long a patient will stay as soon as they enter the hospital and are diagnosed can have many positive effects for a hospital and its efficiency. Beyond benefits to the hospital, predicting patient's length of stay also greatly benefits the patients and patient's families themselves, as they will have an idea of how long they are expected to stay on day 1 of their visit.

Building a predictive model to estimate patient length of stay can provide hospitals with valuable insights into the factors that influence this metric the most. By analyzing patient data from hospital records or electronic health records (EHR), including demographics, medical history, diagnosis codes, procedures performed, medications prescribed, lab results, and other relevant variables, we can develop models that capture the complexities of length of stay prediction. These models enable hospitals to better understand the impact of various factors on the duration of a patient's hospital stay.
